# Phylogenomics of Campos-Rupestres [Newton International Fellowship Project]
This workflow is designed to process and analyse next-generation sequencing (NGS) data in cluster environments. It has been specifically developed to analyse target capture data using the Angiosperms 353 bait set for six distinct lineages well diversified across the Campos Rupestres in eastern Brazil. This project outcome is related to the 'Biodiversity Loss of Campos Rupestres' project, funded through the Royal Society Newton International Fellowship program.
